# Q: Why data should be standardised when performing PCA?
# A: PCA tends to give greater loadings to variables with large numeric range, leading to bias in PCA.
#    That's why standardisation of variables is recommended.

# Display and describe the individual and cumulative proportions of variance
round(summary(pca.df)$importance, 3)

# To cover at least 50% of the total variance, PC1-PC3 are needed
# Because their cumulative proportion is 60% (0.606)

# Display and interpret the coefficients for PC1, PC2 and PC3
round(pca.df$rotation[,1:3], 3)

# Key drivers:
# PC1: 
#     - Average.Request.Size.Bytes (0.544)
#     - Attack.Window.Seconds (0.526)
# PC2: 
#     - Average.ping.to.attacking.IP.milliseconds (0.590)
#     - Average.ping.variability (0.577)
# PC3: 
#     - Hits (0.542)
#     - Average.Attacker.Payload.Entropy.Bits (0.483)
#     - Individual.URLs.requested (0.581)

# PCA PLOT:
# **********************
# There is significant overlap between APT and non-APT groups.
# However, there are still some visible clusters of APT activity toward the left and upper-left quadrants, suggesting some separation may exist along certain directions.
# Most red dots are grouped between -2.5 and 2.5 on the x-axis. 
# In contrast, blue dots are more spread out, ranging from around -5.0 to 3.75.

# LOADING PLOTS:
# ***********************
# The loading plot shows that variables such as (ARSB), (AWS), (APV), and (APTAIM) have long vectors, indicating they are more important contributors to PC1 and PC2. 
# ARSB, AWS, and (AAPEB) are close together and form a tight angle, suggesting they are positively correlated. 
# Similarly, APV and APTAIM also form a small angle, meaning they are highly and positively correlated. 
# However, both APV and APTAIM meet Hits at approximately 90 degrees, indicating no correlation between them. 
# Likewise, ARSB, AWS, and AAPEB form a 90 degree angle with (ASIAC), showing they are uncorrelated. 
# APV and APTAIM form an angle greater than 90 degrees with Hits, suggesting a negative correlation. 
# They are also slightly and negatively correlated with ASIAC, as the angle between them is slightly more than 90 degrees.

# PCA + LOADING PLOTS:
# *************************
# Samples in the same direction as (ARSB), (AWS), and (APV) tend to have higher values in these features compared to those on the opposite side. 
# Likewise, individuals aligned with the direction of (Hits) generally have higher values for that variable. 
# Similarly, samples positioned in the same direction as (APV) and (APTAIM) show higher values for these features than those located in the opposite direction.

# Features that help distinguish APT activity
# *********************************
# Average.Request.Size.Bytes: Long arrow pointing toward APT cluster. Suggests APTs involve larger requests.
# Attack.Window.Seconds     : Indicates more prolonged or persistent attacksâ€”consistent with APT behavior.
# Average.Attacker.Payload.Entropy.Bits: High entropy suggests obfuscation/encryption, typical of APTs.
